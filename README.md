# GolemScript
GolemScript is a datapack library that implements a programming language in to Minecraft.

Once a part of <a href="https://modrinth.com/datapack/code-of-copper" target="_blank">Code of Copper</a>, GolemScript has been separated in to it's own library, to allow for other projects to use it, and for it to be easily extended.
