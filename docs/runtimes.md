# List of Runtimes and Extensions
Here is a list of [runtimes](glossary.md#runtime) and [extensions](glossary.md#extension) to GolemScript which are officially recommended by GMDU.

## Runtimes

### GolemScript Example Runtime
**By GMDU**

This runtime comes built in to the GolemScript datapack, and serves as both an easy way to quickly try out the GolemScript language, and as a point of reference for anyone looking to create their own runtime.

It has minimal features, and the code is all commented, to help readers understand how it works.

See [the documentation](example_runtime.md) for more information.

### Code of Copper
**By GMDU**

Code of Copper is a datapack that allows users to run GolemScript programs to control a moving Copper Golem. It also supports survival gameplay.

See [Code of Copper documentation](https://datapack.dev/docs/code_of_copper){target=_blank} for more information.
